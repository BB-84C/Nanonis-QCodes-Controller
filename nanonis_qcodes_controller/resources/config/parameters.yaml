      docstring_full: 'DataLog.PropsSet

        Sets the acquisition configuration and the save options in the Data Logger
        module.

        Arguments:

        -- Acquisition mode (unsigned int16) means that if Timed (_2), the selected
        channels are acquired during the acquisition duration time or until the user
        presses the Stop button.

        If Continuous (_1), the selected channels are acquired continuously until
        the user presses the Stop button.

        If 0, the is no change in the acquisition mode.

        The acquired data are saved every time the averaged samples buffer reaches
        25.000 samples and when the acquisition stops

        -- Acquisition duration( hours) (int) sets the number of hours the acquisition
        should last. Value -1 means no change

        -- Acquisition duration (minutes) (int) sets the number of minutes. Value
        -1 means no change

        -- Acquisition duration (seconds) (float32) sets the number of seconds. Value
        -1 means no change

        -- Averaging (int) sets how many data samples (received from the real-time
        system) are averaged for one data point saved into file. By increasing this
        value, the noise might decrease, and fewer points per seconds are recorded.

        Use 0 to skip changing this parameter

        -- Basename size (int) is the size in bytes of the Basename string

        -- Basename (string) is base name used for the saved images

        -- Comment size (int) is the size in bytes of the Comment string

        -- Comment (string) is comment saved in the file

        modules string array

        -- Number of modules (int) is the number of elements of the List of modules

        will be saved in the header of the files. The size of each string item should
        come right before it as integer 32
